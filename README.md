# AWS training images
A set of build scripts to generate AWS instances ready to run our training courses.

These are designed to work directly on AWS and some of the steps will be specific to that, but mostly these could also be used on a local instance of the correct operating system to set up a local environment.

Since these are designed for AWS they will generally assume that we start from a minimal install of the relevant operating system, but with all security patches applied.
